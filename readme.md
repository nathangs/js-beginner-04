JavaScript Beginner 04
======================

Create a small bilingual dictionary as a Javascript object in the following fashion: {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"Ã¥r"} and use it to translate your Christmas cards from English into Swedish.

This is part 4 of a series of JavaScript training exercises. It was created for new-ish front end devs, and designers at thunder::tech, but you can use it too!

_this exercise was taken from: http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/teaching/dialogue_systems%20II/labs/javascript.html_
